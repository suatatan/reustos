Welcome to the **ReuStos** repository – your hub for a powerful and flexible toolkit for web scraping! 🕸️

## 🚀 Introduction

**ReuStos** (Reusable Tool for Scraping) is a comprehensive collection of reusable components designed to streamline and simplify web scraping tasks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, **ReuStos** provides you with the tools you need to efficiently gather data from websites, handle HTML structures, manage idle times, randomize requests, implement disk caching, ensure data cleanliness, and much more.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Modular Design**: **ReuStos** is built with modularity in mind. Each scraping component is designed to be independent, making it easy to mix and match according to your needs.

- **HTML Structure Handling**: Tired of dealing with complex HTML structures? **ReuStos** offers solutions to parse and navigate through HTML documents effortlessly.

- **Idle Time Randomizer**: Emulate human-like browsing behavior by incorporating random idle times between requests, reducing the risk of getting blocked by websites.

- **Disk Caching**: Save bandwidth and time by caching scraped data to disk, ensuring that you don't need to repeatedly fetch the same information.

- **Data Cleanliness Checker**: Maintain data integrity by implementing checks to validate and clean scraped data, ensuring accuracy for your downstream processes.

- **GUI**: I believe a Gui for configuration better off. Therefore the plan is the using EEL for the GUI.
